Android operating systems are more commonly used than all other mobile operating systems combined, according to IDC and Net Market Share. Many employees use their personal mobile phones for business purposes such as corporate email access. In the past, some employees would carry two cell phones, one for personal use and one for business. But that quickly became cumbersome, so employees started using their own mobile phones for work. This started the BYOD security challenges. And because small to midsized businesses face daily security threats, locking down that endpoint is more important than ever. 

The Android security solutions we looked at provide protection for employee-owned devices that can be managed from a centralized administration console. They all passed the most recent antivirus security tests from the well-respected independent lab AV-Test. Most endpoint security companies also provide iOS security so you can manage the security for a variety of endpoints including a mixture of Android and iOS tablets and phones.
