Syrian Army retakes new sites from ISIS in Homs province

DAMASCUS, SYRIA (2:30 P.M.) â€“ Syrian Arab Army (SAA) continues its military operations against so-called "Islamic State" (IS, formerly ISIL/ISIS) in Homs countryside.

On Tuesday, units of SAA's 5th Army Corps alongside with National Defense Forces (NDF) launched an attack in the surroundings of the strategic T4 Airbase striking IS positions northwest of this military installation.

The assault proved successful as government forces managed to capture eastern and northwestern slopes of Al-Tafhah hills. Syrian Army used abandoned Armoured Battalion base recaptured from IS approximately two weeks ago as a springboard for today's attack.
